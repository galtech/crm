Basic CRM system

This is a basic CRM system that can be used by individuals or small businesses to manage customers and propects. 
Features include:

- Easy to browse / search company and contact database
- Ability to efficiently add summary of calls / emails
- Easy tracking of all calls / emails with company contacts
- Salesperson reporting function
- Administrative features such as user and data backup management

A future feature I had been working on that I did not release was the ability to generate quotes and invoices within the CRM and 
export the details as PDF and the PDF could then be emailed to customers / prospects.
